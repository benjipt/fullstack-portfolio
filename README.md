## Full-Stack Web Development Portfolio

### Background
Since 2015, I've been working in tech startups leading in a variety of roles alongside customer support, product, and engineering teams. In 2018, while working in a non-technical role, I built an onboarding & support chatbot which would allow our company to scale more efficiently in a new market. This was a valuable experience for me because it revealed that in addition to my skillsets as a capable project & operations leader, I learned that I am also, a creative engineer. I love building products and experiences that help facilitate improvements to sustained quality of life on our world.
